                    <p>I wanted to make something cool and to practice my scripting skills, so i've made screen in roblox where the python script sends my screen's pixels and turns it into hex and then sends it to roblox and then the pixels get created and it repeats. It was slow at the start but i improved it and it was running like in 4fps. Someone bought it from me and then i just stoped making the screen.</p>

                    <p>I wanted to make something cool and to practice my building skills, so you probably saw the screen in roblox, it reused the house i've made from this game. It has scripts like when there is night in real time its night in the game and when it is late it rains.

					<h3>Power Outage Game</h3>
					<p>Power Outage is a game that I released sometime ago. The game is a horror where you are in a house and there is an outage and then things happen â€” for example: A weird guy from out of the window, Fake Pizza Man, Monster out the window, and more. The game is in a classic style. It is a small idea but really fun.

                    <h3>Simple minecraft copy.</h3>
                    <p>I made a minecraft copy, to script the game there were obstacles like the blocks placing in wrong grid, terrain generation glitching out, serversiding it, chunk generation, and many more. The game was never finished</p>

                    <p>Survive in Antarctica was a game that i created for fun and it was about penguins, building houses, and more. The game is still private, i can make it public if you want to see it. The game was just a joke and make without effort dont take it seriously.</p>
